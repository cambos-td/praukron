# /praukron-work

Run `.praukron/praukron status` for the current position, or read
`.praukron/chronicle/README.md` and the compiled views if the tool is
unavailable. Select the requested task, or one ready task if none was named.
Use `.praukron/praukron context <task>` rather than re-deriving its state by
hand; its `lineage` names the task's thesis, phase, and module. If the
requested work has no task yet, create it before implementation without
waiting for a Praukron command, give it one `Module:` from `MODULES.md` (its
phase comes from the module; author a module first if none fits) and a
`Domain:` (`execution` or `operations`), and write its acceptance contract.
Never move a task to another module or a module to another phase as a side
effect of implementation; that is a decision. Read that
task, its contract, and its governing ADRs, then inspect only the specification
and code needed for the task.

Mark it `WIP`, record the owner and claim date, and set `INTENT.md` to that one
task before implementation. Its contract freezes at that moment; change it only
through an accepted Acceptance Change Request. Keep intent at the exact execution point, especially
before a long-running step. When a material choice is made, accepted, or acted
on, append its ADR immediately and link affected tasks. As truth changes, update the
task, its criterion states and evidence, the compiled views, the handoff, and the
journal rather than postponing record keeping. Append an event to `TRACE.md`
for a tool call, command, mutation, failure, or retry that could later explain
an execution failure, a blocked gate, or a regression, naming the task it came
from and what it affects. Summarize; never record secrets, credentials, or
private reasoning.

When a choice has no answer in authority, follow the assumption procedure in
`AGENTS.md` and `docs/SPEC.md` §2.4: read the packet's `policy`; resolve it
from authority, assume it, or stop for the owner. Record an assumption in
`ASSUMPTIONS.md` before relying on it and cite its id where it is applied and
in any criterion evidence that rests on it; mark a permission choice with
`Permissions:` and `Impact: HIGH`. A reserved choice becomes an
`Authority: owner` task the work depends on; notify the owner through the host
when the policy says `Notify: host`, record the time and channel on that task,
and continue other work. Before building on an assumption, reconcile any owner
response the packet shows as awaiting reconciliation.
